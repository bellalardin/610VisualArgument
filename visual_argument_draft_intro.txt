My visual argument is a flyer for a DIY show. I now have all of the essential information listed. Overall, it's very similar to what I submitted for my preview, with a few notable differences.

Although I kept the background and the content essentially the same as in my preview, I made some adjustments based on feedback I got from others and experimenting with different styles. I changed the main font that was being used so that it still appears stylistic but is easier to read. I also chose to alternate between left justification and right justification for each band on the bill. It didn't seem like there was enough empty space when I tried centering everything, and I felt like there was too much in my preview, so this was how I tried to find a balance. I did, however, center the name of the venue at the top. I wasn't sure if I would be adding anything else at the top, but ended up deciding against it. 

I would still like to add something a little more artistic to the flyer, but I'm not sure what that will be. My goal is to make it look overall more aesthetically pleasing while keeping the signal-to-noise ratio almost as high as it currently is.
