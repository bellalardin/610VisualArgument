My idea for the visual argument project was to make a flyer for a DIY show. This is actually a real show that will be happening at my friends' house in December. This isn't the official flyer, but it uses all of the same information as the real one.

My main rhetorical goal is to get people to attend the show. My audience consists of both people who are familiar with the local music scene and those who might not know anything about it. The flyer would be viewed both as a physical copy or as an Instagram post.
