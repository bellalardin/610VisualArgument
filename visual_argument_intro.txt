My idea for the visual argument project was to make a flyer for a DIY show. This is actually a real show that will be happening at my friends' house in December that they've agreed to let me draft a flyer for. The project looks very unfinished right now, partially because I haven't decided how/if to fill up the empty space, and partially because we're still looking for another band to play the show.

My main rhetorical goal, and the most important one, is to get people to attend the show. Additionally, since this is the first flyer I've ever made and there's a chance it will actually get used, it will establish my reputation as a designer within the scene. In other words, just communicating the important information isn't enough, the flyer has to look visually appealing. I also want the flyer to look like it fits in with the others that the house posts, and for it to be equally as effective on Instagram as it would be in a physical copy.
